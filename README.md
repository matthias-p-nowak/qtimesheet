# qtimesheet
another time sheet program - this time with Qt

# Background

In my country, it is common to work 40 hours a week. However, a lunch break of 30 minutes is included.
The employer expects one to register 8 hours on projects each day. Hence, the lunch break must be written on those projects.
So, one actually works 7.5 hours, but writes 8 hours - or for each 15 seconds, 16 seconds are written on a project. 
And then it is custom, not to use smaller units than half an hour for accounting. This makes time keeping a mess.

# overview

It opens a window. In the menu one can select a project to start a stopwatch for. 
A project name containing a simple space is considered the end of the day. 
It shows the amount of work that can be accounted for the last few weeks.
